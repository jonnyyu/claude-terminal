## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed globally
- **Windows** 10 or 11
- **macOS** 12+ (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- **Linux** Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 38+, or equivalent
  - AppImage requires `libfuse2` on Ubuntu 24.04+: `sudo apt install libfuse2`
  - GitHub token storage requires `libsecret`: `sudo apt install libsecret-1-dev gnome-keyring`

## Installation

Download the latest installer from [Releases](https://github.com/Sterll/claude-terminal/releases).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **macOS users:** If you see *"Claude Terminal is damaged and can't be opened"*, run this in Terminal:
> ```bash
> xattr -cr /Applications/Claude\ Terminal.app
> ```
> This is needed because the app is not code-signed yet. Alternatively, right-click the app → Open.

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sterll/claude-terminal.git
cd claude-terminal
npm install
```
